# Chapter 3: Tool Scripts & Prompt Structure

This chapter covers how the ADK parses system instructions (prompts) and dynamically constructs LLM tool schemas from standalone Python functions.

---

## 1. Defining System Instructions (`app/SKILL.md`)

System instructions (the agent's persona and rules) are housed inside the markdown file [app/SKILL.md](file:///Users/rajvekeria/Documents/GitHub/hubscape-agent-template/app/SKILL.md).

* **YAML Frontmatter:** The top of the file contains configurations (name, description) that identify the agent:
  ```markdown
  ---
  name: todo_agent
  description: Manages user tasks and schedules.
  ---
  You are a highly efficient to-do list manager...
  ```
* **Strict Validation Enforcement:** The agent loader `[app/agent.py](file:///Users/rajvekeria/Documents/GitHub/hubscape-agent-template/app/agent.py)` parses `SKILL.md` at boot time. If `SKILL.md` is missing, it raises a `FileNotFoundError`. If the YAML frontmatter delimiters (`---`) or required fields (`name`, `description`) are missing, it raises a `ValueError`.
* **Auto-Scrubbing:** The loader automatically strips the YAML frontmatter and passes only the remaining markdown instructions directly to the `instruction` property of the `google.adk.Agent` instance.
* **Packaging Requirement:** Because `SKILL.md` is parsed dynamically at runtime, it must be bundled inside the deployed wheel package. This is enforced by configuring force-includes under `[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel.force-include]` in `[pyproject.toml](file:///Users/rajvekeria/Documents/GitHub/hubscape-agent-template/pyproject.toml)`:
  ```toml
  [tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel.force-include]
  "app/privileges.json" = "app/privileges.json"
  "app/SKILL.md" = "app/SKILL.md"
  ```

## 2. Implementing Standalone Tool Scripts (`app/scripts/`)

Tools are written as individual, standalone Python files in the `app/scripts/` directory. 

* **Signatures & Schemas:** The function name inside the script must match the filename (e.g., `app/scripts/create_todo.py` must define `async def create_todo(...)`). The ADK automatically parses parameter types, defaults, and docstrings to construct the JSON tool schemas passed to Gemini.
* **Context Handling:** Do not pass the `context` parameter in the tool's function arguments signature. Instead, import and call `get_context()` inside the function body. This keeps the schema definition passed to Gemini clean and free from metadata.
* **No Manual RemoteContext Instantiation:** Do **not** manually instantiate `RemoteContext(...)` or hardcode fallback credentials (e.g., `user_id="dev-user-123"`) inside your tool script body. Tools must rely purely on the active context retrieved via `get_context()`. Manual instantiation bypasses session routing, breaks dynamic multi-user database scoping, and crashes in production where credential-less connections are blocked.

### Example Tool implementation:
```python
# app/scripts/create_todo.py
import logging
from app.core.hubscape_adk import get_context

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

async def create_todo(task_title: str, priority: str = "medium") -> dict:
    """
    Creates a new task in the user's to-do list.

    Args:
        task_title: The title/content of the task.
        priority: The priority level ('high', 'medium', 'low').
    """
    logger.info(f"Adding task: {task_title}")
    context = get_context()
    
    # Standard DB save
    result = context.save(
        scope="user",
        collection_name="tasks",
        doc_id=f"task_{task_title}",
        data={"title": task_title, "priority": priority}
    )
    return {"status": "success", "task": result}
```

## 3. Decommissioning of Inbound API Routes (`api.py`)

GEAP and sandboxed ADK containers run in secure isolated environments. **Inbound HTTP servers (`api.py`) are fully decommissioned.** Custom inbound routing (like custom web routers or Webhook listeners inside the agent) is not supported.

* **OAuth & Webhooks:** If you need to handle OAuth redirects or external callbacks, route them to the central platform backend. The backend processes the events and saves tokens/data into Firestore scopes.
* **Querying State:** The agent then reads this state from the database at runtime using the scoped database client.
* **Outbound Connections:** Outbound HTTP client calls (using `httpx` or similar) are fully supported. Always set strict timeout controls.

---

## 4. Workspace Scope & Tool Filtering (`@tool_scope`)

Tools can be scoped to specific workspace types using `@tool_scope`:
```python
@tool_scope("hub")
async def hub_only_tool():
    ...
```

---

## 5. Google Grounding & Search Architecture Rules (`google_search`, `google_maps`)

When building GEAP agents that use Google Search Grounding (`google_search`) or Google Maps Grounding (`google_maps`):

1. **Tool Isolation Requirement (No Mixed Tool Payloads)**:  
   Google Cloud Vertex AI REST API (`generateContent`) forbids combining built-in Google Grounding extension tools (`google_search`, `google_maps`) with custom Python function declarations (e.g., `search_knowledge`, `create_todo`) in the SAME request payload. Passing both together results in `google.genai.errors.ClientError: 400 INVALID_ARGUMENT ("Multiple tools are supported only when they are all search tools")`.

2. **Dedicated Agent Architecture (Recommended Pattern)**:  
   Build separate, single-purpose agents rather than mixing RAG retrieval and web search into a single agent:
   * **RAG Agents** (`knowledge_agent`): Implement custom function declarations (`search_knowledge`) for searching organizational documents and scraped corpora. Set `"allow_web_search": false` in `app/config.json`.
   * **Web/Search Agents** (`web_search_agent`): Use `google_search` or `google_maps` as their primary native tools. Set `"allow_web_search": true` in `app/config.json`.

3. **Orchestrator Routing**:  
   `host_agent` routes document/policy/file lookups to RAG agents, and routes live web queries, location, and navigation requests to specialized search agents.
ADK filters which tools are exposed to Gemini at runtime using workspace scope annotations and user privilege checks.

### The `@tool_scope` Decorator:
By default, all tools registered in `app/scripts/` are available in both Hub and Organization scopes. To restrict a tool to specific workspace scopes, decorate your tool function with `@tool_scope` from `app.core.hubscape_adk`:

* **`"hub"` scope:** Only accessible if the agent is operating inside a Hub (workspace) session.
* **`"org"` scope:** Only accessible if the agent is operating inside a global Organization/Platform session.

#### Example Usage:
```python
# app/scripts/manage_hub_settings.py
from app.core.hubscape_adk import get_context, tool_scope

@tool_scope(["hub"])
async def manage_hub_settings(setting_key: str, setting_value: str) -> dict:
    """
    Modifies configuration parameters specific to the active Hub.

    Args:
        setting_key: The configuration option key.
        setting_value: The value to configure.
    """
    context = get_context()
    # This tool is guaranteed to only run inside a Hub scope context
    ...
```

### Internal Plumbing (`filter_tools_for_scope`):
Behind the scenes, when the agent is invoked via the REST API, A2A endpoint, or Vertex AI, the framework calls `filter_tools_for_scope()`. This helper:
1. Clones the agent instance.
2. Checks the active scope and strips out any tools decorated with `@tool_scope` if the active scope does not match.
3. Checks the user's active role privileges (from `privileges.json`) and restricts the remaining tools list to only those the user is authorized to execute.
